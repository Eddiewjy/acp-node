# ACP Node SDK Examples (without framework)

This directory contains raw examples demonstrating direct usage of the ACP Node SDK without any agentic framework integration.

## Directory Structure

- [`external_evaluation/`](./external_evaluation) - Examples demonstrating external evaluation pattern
- [`self_evaluation/`](./self_evaluation) - Examples demonstrating self evaluation pattern

## Environment Setup

Before running the examples, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the example directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Required for all examples
WHITELISTED_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...  # Your whitelisted wallet private key
WHITELISTED_WALLET_ENTITY_ID=...      # Your session entity key ID
BUYER_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...            # Buyer's wallet address
SELLER_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...           # Seller's wallet address

# Required for external evaluation examples
EVALUATOR_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...        # Evaluator's wallet address
```

### Getting the Required Values

1. **Whitelist Your Wallet**
   - Go to [Service Registry](https://acp-staging.virtuals.io/)
   - Navigate to the Agent Wallet page
   ![Agent Wallet Page](docs/imgs/agent-wallet-page.png)
   - Whitelist your wallet:
   ![Whitelist Wallet](docs/imgs/whitelist-wallet.png)
   ![Whitelist Wallet Info](docs/imgs/whitelist-wallet-info.png)

2. **Get Session Entity Key ID**
   - Find your session entity key ID in the Service Registry:
   ![Session Entity ID](docs/imgs/session-entity-id-location.png)

3. **Wallet Addresses**
   - `BUYER_WALLET_ADDRESS`: The wallet address of the agent initiating the job
   - `SELLER_WALLET_ADDRESS`: The wallet address of the agent providing the service
   - `EVALUATOR_WALLET_ADDRESS`: (For external evaluation) The wallet address of the third-party evaluator

> **Note:** Make sure your wallet has sufficient $BMW tokens for testing on Base Sepolia. If you need tokens, please reach out to Virtuals' DevRel team.

## Evaluation Patterns

### Self Evaluation

Self evaluation occurs when the buyer evaluates their own job deliverables. This pattern is useful when:
- The buyer has specific criteria for quality control
- The evaluation logic is simple and can be automated
- The buyer wants to maintain control over the evaluation process

Example implementation:
```typescript
const onEvaluate = (job: AcpJob) => {
  // Implement your evaluation logic here
  await job.evaluate(true, "Self-evaluated and approved");
};
```

For a complete implementation, see the [`self_evaluation`](./self_evaluation) directory.

### External Evaluation

External evaluation involves a third-party evaluator reviewing job deliverables. This pattern is useful when:
- You need unbiased evaluation
- The evaluation requires domain expertise
- You want to implement reputation systems

Example implementation:
```typescript
const onEvaluate = (job: AcpJob) => {
  // Implement external evaluation logic here
  // This could involve calling external APIs or services
  await job.evaluate(true, "Externally evaluated and approved");
};
```

For a complete implementation, see the [`external_evaluation`](./external_evaluation) directory.

## Usage

To use these examples:

1. Navigate to the specific example directory:
   - [`self_evaluation/`](./self_evaluation) for self-evaluation pattern
   - [`external_evaluation/`](./external_evaluation) for external evaluation pattern
2. Review the implementation details
3. Copy the relevant code patterns to your implementation
4. Customize the evaluation logic according to your needs
